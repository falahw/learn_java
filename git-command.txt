git clone [github directory online location]
git status --> CHECK whether there are MODIFICATION to SOME FILES or NOT >>>> ALWAYS DO THIS!!! (BEFORE do any git-ACTION) <<<<
git add . --> TRACK all FILES in folder that ABOUT to PUSH to github
*)for 1st COMMIT: git commit -m [TITLE message] -m [DESCRIPTION message] --> *)-m: for message to be displayed in github about the commited change))
*)for NEXT COMMIT: git commit -am [DESCRIPTION message] --> -am: GATHER 'git add' and 'git commit -m ...' AT ONE COMMAND
git push --> push commited change to github
git push origin master --> 'origin' means location of repository on our github, 'master' means the branch that we want to push to

git init --> for INEXISTING DIRECTORY in GITHUB repository
git add [file NAME]
*) git remote add origin https://github.com/falahw/learn_java.git --> PUT a LINK something LIKE THIS
*) git remote -v --> shows ANY REMOTE repository THAT have CONNECTED to the REPOs
git push -u origin master --> USE '-u' SO in the FUTURE it will ONLY NEED to TYPE 'git push'

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C [user]@[domain].com --> Generating public/private rsa key pair

BRANCHING on github
===================
git branch --> to LIST FEATURE BRANCHES in OUR LOCAL-GIT DIRECTORY
=> this COMMAND will LIST something LIKE THIS:
* main/master/[NAME of BRANCH] --> SYMBOL '*' means POSITION of WHICH CURRENT BRANCH are we IN

git checkout --> CAN be used to TRACK MODIFICATIONS in SOME FILES or NOT
git checkout -b [NAME of FEATURE BRANCH] --> SYMBOL '-b' is USED WHEN you NEED to CREATE a FEATURE BRANCH
git checkout [NAME of FEATURE BRANCH] --> USED WHEN you NEED to SWITCH beetwen BRANCH are we IN
git diff [BRANCH name] --> CHECK DIFFERENCES before and after MODIFICATION //input 'q' to QUIT from THIS MODE ONCE you are IN

*)UNCOMMON MERGING practice: git merge [BRANCH name] --> MERGE MODIFICATION from BRANCH feature TO the MAIN/MASTER

*)COMMON MERGING practice:
git push
git push --set-upstream origin [BRANCH name] --> DO this IF the BRANCH is NEVER been SYCNHRONIZED with REPOSITORY in our github
=> COMMAND' --set-upstream' is SORT VERSION of 'u'
git pull <OR> git pull origin master --> PULL UPDATE from MERGED FEATURE BRANCH in github TO LOCAL MASTER
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> master --> to FORCE 'git pull'; DO this BEFORE DOING 'git pull'
git branch -d [BRANCH name] --> DELETE BRANCH with name [BRANCH name]

*)CANCEL MERGING: git merge --abort

STASHING on github (still BRANCH topic)
==================
git stash --> HIDE any FILES with 'modified' STATUS  from COMMAND 'git status' ==> CAN be CONSIDERED as PENDING COMMIT
git stash apply --> UNDO from 'git-stash'

UNDO CHANGES (unstage) on github
======================
git reset [FILE's name]* --> [FILE's name] is OPTIONAL
git reset HEAD~1 --> UNSTAGE and UNCOMMIT LAST CHANGE until 1 COMMIT BEFORE the LAST COMMIT
git restore --staged [FILE's name]

git reset [LOG-HASHCODE] --> UNSTAGE and UNCOMMIT until CERTAIN POINT based on LOG-HASHCODE ==> does NOT MODIFY RESETTED FILES to UNSTAGE/UNCOMMIT VERSION
git reset --hard [LOG-HASHCODE] --> SIMILAR to 'git reset [LOG-HASHCODE]' BUT ==> DOES MODIFY RESETTED FILES to UNSTAGE/UNCOMMIT VERSION
git log --> [LOG-HASHCODE] CAN be GOT from THIS COMMAND; also LIST ALL DONE COMMIT
*) [LOG-HASHCODE] e.g: cda2b3df7aaf931112ac4a2b4326758f43d1ec0d
