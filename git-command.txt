git clone [github directory online location]
git status --> CHECK whether there are MODIFICATION to SOME FILES or NOT
git add . --> TRACK all FILES in folder that ABOUT to PUSH to github
git commit -m [TITLE message] -m [DESCRIPTION message] --> *)-m: for message to be displayed in github about the commited change))
git push --> push commited change to github
git push origin master --> 'origin' means location of repository on our github, 'master' means the branch that we want to push to

git init --> for INEXISTING DIRECTORY in GITHUB repository
git add [file NAME]
*) git remote add origin https://github.com/falahw/learn_java.git --> PUT a LINK something LIKE THIS
*) git remote -v --> shows ANY REMOTE repository THAT have CONNECTED to the REPOs
git push -u origin master --> USE '-u' SO in the FUTURE it will ONLY NEED to TYPE 'git push'

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C [user]@[domain].com --> Generating public/private rsa key pair

BRANCHING on github
===================
git branch --> to LIST FEATURE BRANCHES in OUR LOCAL-GIT DIRECTORY
=> this COMMAND will LIST something LIKE THIS:
* main/master/[NAME of BRANCH] --> SYMBOL '*' means POSITION of WHICH CURRENT BRANCH are we IN

git checkout --> CAN be used to TRACK MODIFICATIONS in SOME FILES or NOT
git checkout -b [NAME of FEATURE BRANCH] --> SYMBOL '-b' is USED WHEN you NEED to CREATE a FEATURE BRANCH
git checkout [NAME of FEATURE BRANCH] --> USED WHEN you NEED to SWITCH beetwen BRANCH are we IN
git diff [BRANCH name] --> CHECK DIFFERENCES before and after MODIFICATION //input 'q' to QUIT from THIS MODE ONCE you are IN

*)UNCOMMON MERGING practice: git merge [BRANCH name] --> MERGE MODIFICATION from BRANCH feature TO the MAIN/MASTER

*)COMMON MERGING practice:
git push
git push --set-upstream origin [BRANCH name] --> DO this IF the BRANCH is NEVER been SYCNHRONIZED with REPOSITORY in our github
=> COMMAND' --set-upstream' is SORT VERSION of 'u'
